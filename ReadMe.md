___

## __Techs__

- C++ for the Code Base
- DirectX3D 11 For Graphic API
- ImGui For The UI Framework
- glfw For Window Manager
- Assimp to load models
- WIC and the DDSTextureLoader of DirectXTex for texture loading
- FMod for music playing and loading
- CMake to compile
- Sol3 and lua for scripting
- reactphysics3D for the physics engine

___

## __To Build__

The project has been compiled using the support of Visual Studio for CMake mainly with Ninja, and clang-cl on windows,
we guarantee at least that it will compile using this method.

The CMakeSettings.json is available to compile,
you can change the compiler and the generator if you do not want to use clang and Ninja, nor msvc and Ninja.

/!\ Be careful, some option of the Cmake does not work suvh as game-only compiling /!\

Assets for the Project are available in the Following Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MkweOgCSBc_fAu7KRT-KTbGxjArFwXry?usp=sharing
... the folder need to be put on the same folder of the executable.

___

## __To Run__

After the compile succeeded the executable can be found in the build/ folder generated by CMake,
the path can be changed in the CMakeSettings.json .

___

## __Additional Notes__

We do not have rights over the Fmod so we removed it for this release, however the code that used it is still available in the files that uses sound.
___

## __User Manual__

This part is the user manual of our engine, it will present to you the feature available and how to use our Engine to make your own game.

Once you run the editor, it should look like this:

![editor_screen](screenshots/editor_screen.PNG)

it might look like that when you open it for the first time:

![bad_init_editor_screen](screenshots/bad_init_editor_screen.PNG)

it is because the imgui.ini was not copied properly during compilation or that it is not near the executable but, do not worry, you can just expand them and put them such as shown below.

![imgui_viewport_example](screenshots/imgui_viewport_example.gif)

this is the example for the viewport but all widget can be expanded and placed to your desire.
if you do not have the widget opened you can find them as shown below, in the Edit or Window options above.

This will be it for the widget that you have at your disposal.

Now some information for the game:

## Known Bugs

pathfinding cannot find a path to attack when AI army is ready

if you don't have assets you may crash

the ui game is hard coded (font and textures)

___

## Additionnal Notes

We only support mesh import via gltf of mesh in one piece.

We do not have parent-child transform system a it is irrelevant for an RTS game.

In the viewport, you can change the buffer that will be printed in it with F1 to F6 keys.
here are the keys:

- F1 -- default buffer
- F2 -- position information
- F3 -- normal information
- F4 -- albedo information
- F5 -- diffuse information
- F6 -- specular information
